# Software-modelling-and-design-project
This is a groupwork project I did when taking the 3rd-year subject Software Modelling and Design at The University of Melbourne. This project was based on a sprite game invented by the head tutor. The goal of this game is to maneuver the car sprite to collect all keys on the puzzle, and then to find the exit while avoiding traps as the car has limited health. Our task was to design and implement a Java program that enabled the car sprite to autopilot and solve the puzzle. Unfortunately we did not manage to finish implementing our design by the due date hence our program was incomplete and could not solve the puzzle. Nonetheless we still attained a satisfactory result, 10 out of 15 marks, as we managed to score well for our design. As this was my first time working on a IT project with a team, it was challenging to maintain an efficient workflow even though we spent way more than the recommended hours to work on this project. Having reflected on this experience, I hope I will be more efficient when doing my upcoming groupwork projects.
